          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am Egue Harris, a Frontend Developer with two years of experience.
            I started my journey about 5 years ago, it was a bit rough due to
            some certain circumstances which i overcame and has led me to a
            massive growth.

              <h3>Area of Low Confidence</h3>
              <p>
                While i am not perfect at what i do, i can&apos;t exactly give a
                list of areas where i have low confidence. Instead, what i feel
                like i might lack is the teamwork experience, which is the major
                reason i joined the internship.

                I know you're acheiving your lifetime goals and dreams wherever
                that it is that you are right now and i want to appreciate you
                for how far you have come and how much further you intend to go.
                I just want to tell you to keep up the good work but also
                remember to take care of yourself while at it.

          <h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            This is my second time joining this internship as a frontend
            developer and i couldn't even get past stage 1 despite how easy it
            might have been. I was in school so i had issues with power and
            class schedules but i'm ready to go all in now that i'm home and i
            have the resources i need to see this through
